## BlueTram_Goban
 This is the git being used for my future graduation project of uni. 
 Its a auto goban connected to OGS.
### Following is how I planed the architecture

Flutter app connects the OGS API, connects to the arduino via bluetooth. According to the API, move is made on the goban with the control of the arduino.

The goban is the last thing I plan on designing. It will use a tram like design that drops the stones on the goban. It will be slow and inefficent but I hope to achieve longevity and novelty.
Other strech goals are;
- Computer vision system so that the moves made by the board owner is also registered automatically.
- AI so that the board can play by itself indefinetly which would add another dimension to the project.
- A long term active art exhibit involving a year long AI game where all moves are made by the BTG.

Project has aspects of app design, iot design, mechtronic design. It lso reflects a hobby of mine. I hope to finish the app and bluetooth sections until the end of February 2022 so that I can present this as a viable project for graduation project course.
